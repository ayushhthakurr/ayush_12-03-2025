# Store Monitoring API

## Overview
This project provides backend APIs to monitor the uptime and downtime of restaurants in the US. Restaurant owners can track their storeâ€™s activity and generate reports based on business hours and active/inactive status logs.

## Features
- **Data Processing**: Parses CSV data from three sources (store activity logs, business hours, and time zones).
- **Real-time Report Generation**: Generates uptime/downtime statistics dynamically.
- **Trigger-Poll Architecture**: API design follows a trigger-and-fetch model for efficient data retrieval.
- **Database Integration**: Stores parsed data and generates reports based on live data.
- **Extrapolation Logic**: Fills missing data points within business hours using interpolation techniques.

## APIs
### **1. Trigger Report**
**Endpoint:**
```
POST /trigger_report
```
**Response:**
```json
{
  "report_id": "<random_string>"
}
```

### **2. Get Report**
**Endpoint:**
```
GET /get_report?report_id=<report_id>
```
**Response:**
- If report is still processing:
  ```json
  {
    "status": "Running"
  }
  ```
- If report is complete:
  ```json
  {
    "status": "Complete",
    "csv_file": "<download_link>"
  }
  ```

## Challenges Faced
### **1. Complex Prediction Logic**
- Extrapolating uptime and downtime between periodic observations was challenging, especially for calculating last hour and last day.
- Required careful handling of missing data, edge cases, and interpolation techniques.

### **2. Handling Different Time Zones**
- Business hours were in local time, while store activity logs were in UTC, making direct comparisons difficult.
- Implemented a conversion mechanism to standardize time calculations.

### **3. Optimizing Query Performance**
- Fetching large datasets and computing uptime/downtime efficiently required indexing and caching strategies.

## Future Improvements
- **Real-time Streaming**: Implementing WebSockets or Kafka for real-time monitoring.
- **Better Interpolation Techniques**: Improve uptime/downtime estimation using ML models.
- **Automated Alerts**: Notify restaurant owners when downtime exceeds a threshold.
- **Scalability Enhancements**: Optimize database structure for handling large-scale data.

## Setup and Execution
### **1. Install Dependencies**
```sh
npm install
```

### **2. Start the Server**
```sh
npm run dev
```

### **3. Check Database Tables**
```sql
SELECT * FROM reports;
SELECT * FROM report_statuses;
```

### **4. Trigger Report**
Use Postman or CURL:
```sh
curl -X POST http://localhost:3004/trigger_report
```

### **5. Check Report Status**
```sh
curl -X GET http://localhost:3004/get_report?report_id=<generated_report_id>
```
